Settle-Ours
A board game app to definitively prove who is the best Settlers of Catan player. Hint, it's probably going to be me...

The backend is built with Node, Express and MySQL with a frontend using Vue and Firebase Auth. This app allows users to create an account, choose a username, and create/record game data. Other users can join the game record or the game creator can create temp usernames. The data is recorded and then users can check their stats for each game.

If you want to clone this, you will need to set up your own Firebase Auth connection and DB connection.
